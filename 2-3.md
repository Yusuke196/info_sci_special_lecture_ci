## How can we use test fixtures for efficiency?

It is a good practice to use setUpModule or setUpClass to set up objects which are repeatedly used in test cases. By these methods, we can keep the objects while we are in the module or the class. These setUpX methods are sometimes paired with tearDownX methods, which delete the objects at the end to clear up the memory.

Please find examples of `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` in `2-2.py`.
